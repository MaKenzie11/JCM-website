   README file: Smooth Operators



We are the Smooth Operators and our names are Alana Hymes and MaKenzie Winters. We attend JCM Early College High and we are in the 9th grade. We worked on the pages separately and brought them together. We each worked on about, home, highlights, schedule,and stats .We used the colors green, gold, black, and white for ourwebsite  because they are our school colors and our basketball team colors.

 One of our biggest struggles was time management because MaKenzie had volleyball, band, and dance practice. Alana had auditions, concerts, dress rehearsals, and helping her grandmother. We have other classes that we have to do work for so we had to schedule a time to work on our website.

 We created custom videos for our clients that are located  on our “Home” page. MaKenzie went above and beyond on our logo and positioning it on our website. Alana went above and beyond getting our pictures to work and putting the logo on the navbar.Thank you for viewing our website.


                       With all the Love, Smooth Operators
